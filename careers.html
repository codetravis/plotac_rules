            <h2>Pilot Careers Overview</h2>
            <p>Each Pirate pilot can follow 1 of 8 Career Paths starting at rank 1. At each Rank the pilot gets access to upgrades and abilities based on their Career. If your pilot dies, feel free to try a different career path with the next one.</p>

                    <h3>Organizer</h3>
                    <p>The Organizer is all about coordinating the efforts of the team, moving resources where they are needed and bringing in skilled crew. <strong>You may only have 1 Organizer on your team.</strong> They are the only pilot who may hire and use all non-generic crew with XP instead of Credits, Scum Crew hires this way are treated as permanent upgrades. You may only permanently hire Scum crew for the slots obtained by ranking up, not for the default crew slots on ships. You can still temp hire Scum crew for default ship crew slots using credits.</p>
                    
                    <p>A pilot on the Organizer path gets a white Coordinate action at rank 3, a red linked Coordinate at rank 4, and a white linked Coordinate at rank 7. It is possible to link these Coordinate Actions to any Action available for the ship type.</p>
                    
                    <p>At rank 5, and 7 the Organizer gains an extra Crew Slot. You may bring along extra crew equal to the number of crew slots you have unlocked on any ship you fly that already had an existing crew slot.</p>
                    
                    <p>At ranks 3 and 8 the Organizer gains access to Organizer Pilot Abilities.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p>Piracy, and crime in general, is all about credits. As such, this is the primary resource and one of the main rewards from each mission. Each pilot gets an equal share of the credits earned from each mission. One share is also set aside for running the operation. If the credits do not divide equally, the extra credits go to the operation share.</p>
            
            <p>The operation deducts half to pay your support crew (rounded up) and the other half goes into the operation bank. For example if each share is 15k Credits, 8k is used to pay the support crew and 7k from the Company share will go into the operation bank. The players may use this bank to pay for Patrol Boat upgrades.</p>
            
            <p>Some missions you will get credits for completing. Some you will get credits for each successful objective completed. And some missions will create an income stream of credits that you get after every mission you complete.</p>
            
            <p>Credits can be used to buy new ships and buy upgrades for your existing ships (think U&M points from Flight Group Alpha), and repair your PB-950 Patrol Boat. Potential expansion ideas are using credits for base crew, contacts and hiring mercenaries / bounty hunters to help you on missions.</p>
            
            <h3>Selling Your Ship</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you want to upgrade ships but in order to afford a new one, you need to sell the one you have or one you captures. But the shipyard owners aren't going to want to buy a pirate ship at full price. Also the market demand is always changing.</p>
            
            <p>When you wish to sell your ship, roll a D6. On a 1 or 2, you are offered 33% (1/3) of the total value (rounded up), on a 3-5 you are offered 50% (1/2) of the total value (rounded up), and on a 6 you are offered 75% (3/4) of the original value plus 50% (1/2) of all the upgrades (rounded up).</p>
            
            <p>For example, you captured a Mining Guild TIE and wish to sell it. If you roll a 1-2 you will be offered $22k/3 = $8k (rounded up), on a 3-5 you will be offered $22k/2 = $11k, and on a 6 you will be offered $22k * 3/4 = $17k (rounded up).</p>
            
            <p>You can choose to accept or reject the offer and try again after the next mission.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Experience / XP</h2>
            <p>All of the XP earned from a single mission is pooled and dealt out to the pilots that went on that mission. But it is still important to track individual contributions for the Lead by Example bonus (see below). If a pilot chooses to bank some of the XP and then is killed, that XP is lost. Keeping your experienced pilots alive should be top priority.</p>
            
            <p>If earned XP does not divide evenly, the extra XP can be awarded to either the pilot who earned the most XP for the mission or the pilot with the lowest level / least XP to catch them up. (Especially in the case of a pilot being killed and needing to level up a new one)</p>
            
            <p>XP can be spent on leveling up your Pilot, Elite Talents, Scum Pilot Abilities, and Scum Crew upgrades for the Organizer and Cyborg Career paths (see Pilot section for more info).</p>

            <p>Pilots do not gain XP for damage an enemy ship does to itself such as colliding with an asteroid or bumping another enemy ship. They also do not gain XP if a friendly ship (including the Company Patrol Boat) deals the damage. They can still get kill assist XP however if they previously damaged the ship and then it is destroyed by damaging itself or by a friendly ship.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kill and Damage Assists:</strong> If pilot A Coordinates pilot B or uses any ability to give pilot B an action, token, charge, etc; then pilot B does damage to an enemy ship or destroys an enemy ship. Pilot A gains 1 XP for assisting.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lead by Example:</strong> If one pilot earned at least 2 more XP than the next closest pilot in a mission gets, they gain +1 XP after the XP pool is dealt out.</p>

            <h2>Ejection Roles</h2>
            <p>Whenever a ship is destroyed or disabled, the pilot makes an ejection roll using Red Attack Dice. The number of dice rolled is determined by the Territory of the mission. Some missions change Territory type depending on your success or failure.</p>
            
            <p>For Friendly Territory, roll 1 Die. For Neutral Territory roll 2 Dice. For Hostile Territory roll 3 Dice.</p>
            
            <p>If your ship is equipped with the Deadman's Switch Illicit upgrade and is destroyed, add 1 Die to your Ejection roll (Does not apply to Demolitions Career from Rank 2+). Do not add a Die if the ship was disabled by ionization instead.</p>

The rest of the crew may vote to save your life by turning you into a Cyborg at a cost of 50k Credits or allow you to pass on. This cost can be paid out of the injured pilots credits, the remaining pilots credits, and the operation credit bank in any combination as agreed on by the surviving crew. You retain all pilot skills and abilities acquired in your current career to this point but all future level ups are on the Cyborg career path. Swap all Focus actions to Calculates. Note: If the pilot was already a Cyborg, they can still be saved. If the cost to save them is paid, treat the ejection as a Double Eye role and they gain no XP as what they learned is lost in their destroyed cybernetics.</td>

            <p>On pilot death, all the credits they have banked are passed on to their next of kin. If they have a spare ship in the hangar, the surviving crew may vote on whether to assign it to a replacement pilot, bid on it to be their spare ship, or sell it and divide the proceeds. The dead pilot does not get a vote. A pilot who retires from 2 permanent injuries takes their spare ship with them.</p>
