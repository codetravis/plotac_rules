            <h2>Optional Ships from the EU</h2>
            <p>Pirates and civilian merchants rarely have access to top of the line fighters. Making do with older models and ships cobbled together from whatever parts are lying around. Local system patrols also have ships used for fighting off pirates and capturing smugglers.</p>
            
            <p>All of these ships can be fairly easily proxied and all share dials with an existing ship.</p>

                    <h3>TYE-Wing</h3>
                    <p>The TYE-Wing is a combination of a TIE Fighter cockpit and sensor package and Y-Wing weapons and engines. The other thing it combines is their weaknesses. Slow as a Y-Wing with the low survivability of the TIE. The only good thing about the TYE-Wing is that it is cheap. While usually good enough to deal with most civilian ships, it falls short when facing front line fighters.</p>
                    
                    <p>The TYE-Wing uses the same maneuver dial as a Y-Wing with the addition of a Red 3 Koiogran turn. You can find a 3D model suitable for casual X-Wing play on Thingiverse. Alternatively it can be kit bashed from TIE Fighter and Y-Wing parts.</p>

                    <h3>Y-TIE</h3>
                    <p>The Y-TIE combines the engines and solar panels of the TIE with the fuselage and cockpit of the Y-Wing. The missile tubes and bomb bay have been removed to make space for the TIE engines and additional wiring. This combo leaves it underpowered and one of the slowest fighters around.</p>
                    
                    <p>It retains a little of the Y-Wings ruggedness and can still be deadly with the added firepower of a turret. Y-TIEs work best in packs and are easy pickings when caught out alone.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Y-TIE uses the same dial as the T4-a Lambda Shuttle.</p>

                    <h3>Patchwork Y-Wing</h3>
                    <p>The Gearhead can choose to convert a TYE-Wing and a Y-TIE into a Patchwork Y-Wing if they wish. It looks and flies like a Y-Wing but is still missing key systems such as the bomb bay, missile tubes, and hyperdrive. It also keeps the Patchwork Ship hazard.</p>

                    <h3>GAT-12h Skipray Blastboat</h3>
                    <p>A favorite of local patrols and pirates alike, the Skipray Blastboat is well suited for disabling enemy ships with its primary Ion cannons. Strong shields and a laser turret help it deal with more maneuverable fighters. It can also be armed with either missiles or torpedoes as the mission profile demands.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Skipray Blastboat uses the same dial as the Scurrg H-6 Bomber.</p>

                    <h3>PB-950 Patrol Boat</h3>
                    <p>Due to its age, it is difficult to get stock replacement parts for the PB-950. However smugglers, local patrols and pirates will keep them going as long as possible due to their reliability and ruggedness. Primary ion cannons are useful for disabling opponents while a turret is used to defend against smaller craft.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Patrol Boat uses the same dial as the YT-49 Decimator.</p>

            <h2>Optional Custom Upgrades</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you have to wire in systems to things they weren't meant to or just slap some metal plates to the outside of a ship where they don't belong to add some survivability. On that note there are a handful of new upgrades available in the PLotAC campaign. Mostly meant as inexpensive junkyard and jury-rigged upgrades.</p>
            
            <p>You can find their cost in the upgrades cost table section.</p>

                <div class="upgrade-card">
                    <h3>Bolt on Ion Cannon</h3>
                    <p>The ship doesn’t really have the power relays setup for this and it isn’t exactly connected to the ships targeting system but you have yourself an Ion Cannon. Note: It cannot be used for range 0 attacks.</p>
                    <img class="upgrade-card-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codetravis/CustomShipsTTSXWing/master/assets/cards/upgrades/boltonioncannon.png">

                    <h3>Makeshift Hull Plates</h3>
                    <p>It might stop one more laser bolt but its gonna make you an easier target.</p>
                    <img class="upgrade-card-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codetravis/CustomShipsTTSXWing/master/assets/cards//upgrades/makshifthullplates.png">

                    <h3>Scavenged Shield Generator</h3>
                    <p>You may get some feedback when you take a hit, but the shielding may just save your life. Note: Can only be added to an unshielded ship.</p>
                    <img class="upgrade-card-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codetravis/CustomShipsTTSXWing/master/assets/cards//upgrades/scavengedshieldgenerator.png">

                    <h3>Homemade Signal Jammer</h3>
                    <p>The battery burns out after a single use and the signal is not directed. Extremely useful for tight spots.</p>
                    <img class="upgrade-card-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codetravis/CustomShipsTTSXWing/master/assets/cards//upgrades/homemadesignaljammer.png">

                    <h3>Improvised Bomb Rack</h3>
                    <p>There is no telling where the bomb will end up after you drop it, but you have successfully turned your ship into a bomber.</p>
                    <img class="upgrade-card-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codetravis/CustomShipsTTSXWing/master/assets/cards//upgrades/improvisedbombrack.png">

                    <h3>Podracer's Handicap</h3>
                    <p>You learned how to set this up from some Podracing mechanics with questionable morals. Only enough juice for one burn, but sometimes that’s all you need.</p>
