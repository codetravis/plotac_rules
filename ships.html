            <h2>Optional Ships from the EU</h2>
            <p>Pirates and civilian merchants rarely have access to top of the line fighters. Making do with older models and ships cobbled together from whatever parts are lying around. Local system patrols also have ships used for fighting off pirates and capturing smugglers.</p>
            
            <p>All of these ships can be fairly easily proxied and all share dials with an existing ship.</p>

                    <h3>TYE-Wing</h3>
                    <p>The TYE-Wing is a combination of a TIE Fighter cockpit and sensor package and Y-Wing weapons and engines. The other thing it combines is their weaknesses. Slow as a Y-Wing with the low survivability of the TIE. The only good thing about the TYE-Wing is that it is cheap. While usually good enough to deal with most civilian ships, it falls short when facing front line fighters.</p>
                    
                    <p>The TYE-Wing uses the same maneuver dial as a Y-Wing. You can find a 3D model suitable for casual X-Wing play on Thingiverse. Alternatively it can be kit bashed from TIE Fighter and Y-Wing parts.</p>

                    <h3>Y-TIE</h3>
                    <p>The Y-TIE combines the engines and solar panels of the TIE with the fuselage and cockpit of the Y-Wing. The missile tubes and bomb bay have been removed to make space for the TIE engines and additional wiring. This combo leaves it underpowered and one of the slowest fighters around.</p>
                    
                    <p>It retains a little of the Y-Wings ruggedness and can still be deadly with the added firepower of a turret. Y-TIEs work best in packs and are easy pickings when caught out alone.</p>

It looks and flies like a Y-Wing but is still missing key systems such as the bomb bay, missile tubes, and hyperdrive. It also keeps the Patchwork Ship hazard.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you have to wire in systems to things they weren't meant to or just slap some metal plates to the outside of a ship where they don't belong to add some survivability. On that note there are a handful of new upgrades available in the PLotAC campaign. Mostly meant as inexpensive junkyard and jury-rigged upgrades.</p>

                    <h3>Homemade Signal Jammer</h3>
                    <p><strong>Illicit • 1 Credit</strong></p>
                    <p>Action: Jam all ships at range 0-1. Then discard this card. The battery burns out after a single use and the signal is not directed. Extremely useful for tight spots.</p>

                    <p><strong>Illicit • 2 Credits</strong></p>
                    <p>You may equip 1 Payload upgrade (paying its cost as normal). After you drop or launch a device from a Payload upgrade, roll 1 attack die. On a hit or crit result, the device deviates. Move the device using the [1 Straight] template in a random direction. There is no telling where the bomb will end up after you drop it, but you have successfully turned your ship into a bomber.</p>

                    <p><strong>Illicit • 1-5 Credits (based on ship size)</strong></p>
                    <p>Action: Gain 1 disarm token and 1 strain token. Then perform a boost action, even while stressed. After you perform this action, flip this card. You learned how to set this up from some Podracing mechanics with questionable morals. Only enough juice for one burn, but sometimes that's all you need.</p>

                <li><strong>Company Credits:</strong> $5k (for use in Repairing the Patrol Boat)</li>
                <li><strong>Pilots:</strong> 3-6 Pilots with 0 XP and 0 Credits each. Initiative 1</li>
                <li><strong>Ships:</strong> 1 Starting ship per pilot based on their Career</li>
                <li><strong>Patrol Boat:</strong> 1 PB-950 Patrol Boat needing major repairs (will come on some missions)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If you don't want to use the custom ships, start the Campaign with the New Rides mission to have the player steal ships from the Local Patrol. Alternatively they may start in Z-95 Headhunters with no upgrades. To Proxy the TYE Wing, you can use a Y-Wing as they share a dial and only allow for 3 Hull hits.</p>
