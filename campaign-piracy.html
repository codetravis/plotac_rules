The ships themselves have too tight of security, but the exchange shuttle will have a small window of vulnerability as it passes by the asteroid field. Disable it and loot the passengers for valuables. Be quick before local and Imperial patrols have time to respond. We have our Patrol Boat coming along as a Boarding Craft.</p>

When a Freighter is inspected (by performing a Scan action within range 1 of the Freighter) draw a number from the bag. If it is a 1, you have found the valuable cargo.</p>

                    <p>Between us and the Rebels, the Imperial patrols are stretched thin. To give them an early warning system they have set up a sensor net in the asteroid field. We need to create a blind spot to give ourselves an opportunity to hit a passing freighter convoy. Take out the sensors so they won't see us coming. Be careful not to trigger the sensor net and bring in any patrols. Using Ion weapons will make it look like equipment failure and keep the suspicions down.</p>

                    <p>The Imperials have increased their presence in the sector as a result of the Rebel activity and our Piracy but they are stretched thin. They have resorted to using their bombers on patrol and escort duty. The bomber escorted convoys are much better targets and we found one with a light escort.

                    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                    <p>A local contact has let us know of a juicy score. Due to scheduling conflicts caused by the arrival of a high ranking Imperial Officer, there is a freighter that will be passing our area with no escort at all. It also seems they have a new navigator and have got themselves trapped in the asteroid field. This is too good of an opportunity to pass up.</p>
                    <p><strong>Post Ambush Instructions:</strong> We've been sold out. Abort mission. Get out of there but try to discourage pursuit. Those fighters that deployed from the freighter are likely prototypes from the Imperial research station, if you can get in close and get some scan data on them we may be able to make some profit off this mess.</p>
