Lets show them why it would be a good idea by damaging one of their installations. Get in and get out before the Local System Patrols can respond with reinforcements. If we can demonstrate our pilots skill vs theirs it might help convince them they need protecting.</p>

                        <h4>Special Rules</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Station Command Module:</strong> Can give 1 of the Turbolaser modules a Calculate Token each turn before the Turbolasers activate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assaulting the Station:</strong> Players ships may perform the Protect action on the Patrol Boat. To Unload the Boarding Team, the Patrol Boat must land in one of the station's Docking Bays after the Shield Generators have been destroyed. Place a Tracking Token on the Docking Bay tile to represent the Boarding Team.</li>
                            <li><strong>Advancing the Boarding Team:</strong> At the end of each turn, roll 3 attack dice. If the number of hits rolled is equal to or greater than the number of emplacements on that station tile, players may move the commandos to an adjacent station tile. Otherwise, they may destroy one emplacement on that tile or simply wait until the next round. Players may choose if Fuel Tanks destroyed this way explode. The Boarding Teams attack dice can be modified depending on the upgrades purchased for the Patrol Boat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Capturing the Guild Foreman:</strong> The Boarding Team must reach the large central station module with the Command Center. Then they must succeed in their advancement roll to enter the Command Center and capture the station. Any remaining Turbolaser emplacements are now under Pirate control. Players may choose their facing and attack targets for the rest of the mission. If the command center is destroyed no rewards are gained from completing this mission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enemy Target Priority:</strong> Once the station is captured and the turbolasers start shooting at the Mining Guild and mercenary ships, they will attempt to destroy the station's defenses without damaging the rest of the station. Target priority will be any Player ships (including Patrol Boat) in firing arc followed by station turbolaser towers.</li>
                            <li>If the Pirates have control of the station at the end of turn 12, the territory is considered neutral and the enemy forces retreat and the mission ends. Note: unless you have destroyed or disabled all enemy ships by the end of turn 12, you cannot capture disabled ships.</li>
                            <li>The Pirates may continue to pursue the primary objective after turn 12 but the Imperial forces will not retreat once the station is captured. Delta squadron has Strike AI against the station if it is captured.</li>
                            <li>Imperial ships have target priority of Player ships in arc, then station modules in order of Command Center, Turbolaser, Fuel Tank.</li>
