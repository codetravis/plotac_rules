                    <p>Normally we aren't bounty hunters but this one has practically fallen into our lap. An Imperial Defector is set to meet with the Rebels in this sector and we have obtained information on the meeting time and place.

                    <p>If at any point the shuttle is disabled and there are no more enemy ships on the board, the mission ends in success.</p>

                        <h4>The Shuttle</h4>
                        <p>The Shuttle will engage and attack the nearest target as usual. Once it has suffered 5 damage of any kind (shield or hull) it will switch to Flee AI and try to escape from edge B. Treat that edge as the priority target for movement, and always use the shuttle's maximum speed for the selected bearing.</p>
                        <p>The Shuttle is represented by the Omnicron Group Pilot and has the upgrade <strong>Anti-Pursuit Lasers</strong>: After an Enemy ship performs a maneuver that cause it to overlap you ship, roll 1 Attack die. On a Hit or a Crit result, the Enemy ship suffers one damage.</p>
                        <p>The Shuttle is disabled immediately when it has 1-3 Hull remaining. However if the shuttle is reduced to 0 Hull, it is still destroyed as usual and the players fail the mission. The player that disables the shuttle gains 4xp.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Patrol Boat and Rebel Freighter</h4>
                        <p>The Patrol Boat arrives the turn after the shuttle is disabled. Player ships may perform the Protect action on the Patrol Boat.</p>
                        <p>Once the Patrol Boat arrives, all ships with Escort AI switch to Strike AI against the Patrol Boat.</p>
                        <p>The Rebel Freighter arrives the turn after the Patrol Boat arrives and has Strike AI targeting it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Rebel Determination</h4>
                        <p>All Rebel ships have been told this mission has increased priority and their Flee threshold is modified to be 1 Hull (instead of the usual 2 printed on the AI card).</p>
