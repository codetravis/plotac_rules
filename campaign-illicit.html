                    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                    <p>Piracy isn't the only way to make credits. Offering protection services to smugglers pays the bills and also can build goodwill. A spice smuggler has ran into some problems and has local patrols hot on their tail. They have contacted us to cover them while they escape.</p>
                    <p>Their HWK-290 has been hit pretty hard by pursuing patrols and their hyperdrive and weapons systems are currently inoperable. Keep the local and Imperial patrols off them long enough to get into the asteroid field and we will patch them up back at our base.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mission-section">
                    <h3>Setup</h3>
                    <p>Player setup zone B, Spice Runner HWK-290 setup zone A, 6 asteroids in area C randomly placed > range 1 apart</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mission-section">
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The Spice Runner HWK-290 must escape from your setup edge (B) then each player ship may escape off the board off any edge other than the edge touching zone A or jump to hyperspace. The player ships do NOT have to escape for the mission to be a success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Objective:</strong> 2 XP to all pilots if all Elite enemy pilots are destroyed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Objective:</strong> The pilot who performs the most protect actions on the HWK gains 2xp directly (not shared in the group pool). If there is a tie, all tied pilots gain 1xp directly (not shared in the group pool).</p>
                    <p><strong>Secondary Objective:</strong> If the Smuggler's HWK is disabled by an Ion Weapon instead of destroyed, you get a second chance to help them. Any pilot that is flying a ship with an empty Crew slot or the players Patrol Boat may dock with the HWK and then escape for the half the reward (rounded up).</p>

                        <h4>The Smuggler</h4>
                        <p>The Smuggler is represented by a Spice Runner HWK-290 Initiative 1 with no upgrades.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to damage from pursuing patrols, their weapons and hyperdrive are offline.</li>
                            <li>The ship begins the mission with the "Damaged Sensor Array" critical hit and a number of shields equal to the number of pirate pilots flying the mission.</li>
                            <li>The HWK also has damaged engines and is unable to perform the Boost action, and Speed 4 maneuvers are treated as Red.</li>
                            <li><strong>One Last Trick Up Their Sleeve</strong> – the HWK has Thermal Detonators with a single Charge. It can drop at any turn the player(s) choose using the 1 Straight template during the System phase.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Players decide as a team how to plan the Smuggler's dial. The ship may perform actions as normal (other than boost) once repairing the Damaged Sensor Array critical hit.</p>
                        <p>The HWK escapes immediately if all or part of its base overlaps the the edge of the play area along the escape zone (area B). Pirate pilots may perform the Protect action on the Smuggler's HWK.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Local Patrol</h4>
                        <p>The Local Patrol craft (Z-95s and Y-Wings) are armed with ion weapons (Ion Missiles for Z-95s and Ion Turrets for Y-Wings). They have Strike AI against the HWK and will only attack it if they have an attack with an Ion Weapon. Otherwise they will attempt to make normal attacks against the pirate ships.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Dingo Squadron</h4>
                        <p>If the HWK is disabled by Ion weapons instead of destroyed, the Dingo squadron Patrol Boat (can be represented with any Large base ship using a Decimator maneuver dial) arrives in Zone A and the players Patrol Boat arrives in Zone B. The Patrol Boat Dingo will head for the HWK and attempt to dock with it. If the Dingo successfully docks with the HWK then the mission is a failure. The player Patrol Boat or any pirate pilot flying a ship with a Crew slot may also attempt to dock with the HWK to rescue the crew and some of the cargo. They must then escape off board edge B.</p>

                        <h4>Slicer Tech Setup</h4>
                        <p>The Slicer Techs are represented by a Spice Runner HWK-290 equipped with an Ion Cannon Turret and +1 Shield for every 2 player ships (0 for 3, 1 for 4, 2 for 5, and 2 for 6). The players decide as a team how to plan the HWK's dial each round, and the ship may perform actions and attacks as normal. The pirates may use the Protect action on this HWK.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Holonet Relay Setup</h4>
                        <p>During setup, put the number tokens 10-12 into the draw bag. Add one other token for each player ship.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Disabling Relays and Emplacements</h4>
                        <p>Satellite Relays have 2 Agility and 3 Hull, Sensor Arrays have 0 Agility and 5 Hull. Both are considered "channels" for the holonet receiver. They can be attacked and are considered disabled when they have 1 hull left or gain an Ion Token. A disabled channel is considered marked.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Marking Channels</h4>
                        <p>The Slicer Techs or any Slicer Pirate may perform the Scan Action at range 0-1 instead of disabling to Mark a Channel. Earn 1XP for marking a channel, then draw a number and assign it to mark that channel. If 12 is drawn, mark the channel with a critical hit token instead. The vulnerable holonet channel has been identified. If all channels have been marked except for 1 and no channel has yet been identified as the vulnerable channel, the remaining channel is marked as vulnerable.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Accidentally Destroying Channels</h4>
                        <p>Each time a channel is destroyed, draw a number and remove it. The mission is a failure if the 12 is removed prior to being assigned to a receiver.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Inspection Squad (Strike Priority)</h4>
                        <p>Once the vulnerable communication channel has been identified, the Inspection Squad arrives at the start of the following turn. These ships will prioritize the Slicer Techs, but will attack other Pirate ships if they cannot attack the HWK.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hijacking the Holonet Channel</h4>
                        <p>The Slicer Techs (or a Lvl 4+ Slicer Pirate) may perform a Scan Action on a Holonet Relay that is marked as vulnerable in order to Hijack it. Once the channel is Hijacked and the Slicer that did the Hijacking escapes, the mission is a success.</p>

                    <p>Rumors that the latest Sienar Fleet Systems prototype TIEs are being tested nearby. The Sienar Fleet Systems competitors would love to have data on the new TIE. The Rebels would likely pay for it too. The more detailed the data, the better.</p>

For each successful scan, up to 2 per Prototype type (max 4), the mission rewards increase as you get higher detailed information about the ships performance. You only get rewards for scan data that is successfully escaped with. Each ship may only carry 1 scan worth of data per its size (small base ship can scan 1x, medium base 2x, large base 3x). Exception is Slicer pilot who adds +1 to their maximum.</p>
