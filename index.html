            <h1>Pirate Lords of the Arturi Cluster (PLotAC)</h1>
            <h2>A Scum and Villainy HotAC Campaign</h2>
        </header>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There is a fantastic single player / cooperative campaign for the Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures game called Heroes of the Arturi Cluster or HotAC for short. The original HotAC has the players as Rebel pilots vs the Empire.</p>
            
            <p>Then there is Flight Group Alpha (FGA) which has missions based on the old TIE Fighter game. In that you fly for the Empire.</p>
            
            <p>But I have not come across an easily found campaign for the Scum and Villainy faction. I did stumble onto a PDF inside of a Table Top Simulator Mod for HotAC that had the beginnings of how you would play a Scum campaign called "Villains of the Arturi Cluster" written by the creator of the FGA campaign but it was unfinished.</p>
            
            <p>There were pilot cards and a couple of different angles suggested on how to play it but no campaign actually created.</p>
            
            <p>This is my attempt to write a Scum faction campaign that hopefully others will enjoy.</p>
            
            <div class="warning">
                <strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a living document and the campaign has not yet been fully playtested or balanced. You can send any playtest notes you have to travis at evolvingdeveloper.com

            <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
            <p>Many of the missions, mechanics and gameplay elements were originally developed for the above mentioned Heroes of the Arturi Cluster Co-op Campaign by Josh Derksen, and have been updated from X-Wing version 1.0 to 2.0 and beyond by Shaun Tiernan with help from others. This campaign utilizes the terrain and components developed for HotAC very heavily.</p>
            
            <p>Additional gameplay elements and mission structures from Flight Group Alpha and Villains of the Outer Rim by Claes Sorensson who was also inspired by Heroes of the Arturi Cluster.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the Pirate flavor such as the Pirates Code, the PB-950 Patrol Boat, and some mission themes were inspired by the old West End Games Pirates and Privateers RPG guide.</p>
            
            <p>The costs and upgrade charts originally based off of the excellent X2PO guide to points costs with my own customizations. Version 2.0 points worked better for a "Credit" based rewards system.</p>

            <h3>Premise</h3>
            <p>You are trying to setup shop as pirates in the Arturi Cluster. You have gathered a group of eager but inexperienced pilots and some ships from a local scrapyard. Time to start making some credits.</p>
            
            <p>This campaign can be played solo or with an individual flying each ship or a group of ships. It can accommodate up to 6 players.</p>
            
            <div class="author-note">
                <strong>Author's Note:</strong> This campaign is designed to be somewhat challenging. You are likely to lose pilots and ships early on when the equipment is poor and the skills low.
