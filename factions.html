                <h3>Local Patrols</h3>
                <p>Most systems have regular patrols to look for suspicious activity and to scout for ships in distress. The equipment allotted to these patrols is usually whatever the local government can find for sale. They are not so desperate as to use junkyard ships as they can acquire their gear through legitimate purchase. If feeling, overwhelmed they will call for Imperial assistance.</p>
                
                <p>The good news is disabling their opponents is the Local Patrols first priority and they will prioritize using Ion based weapons, unless the target has destroyed one of their ships. They also have a high degree of self preservation and will flee if brought too low.</p>
                
                <p>On the mission forces tables, Local Patrols tend to use the following squadron names (Able, Bravo, Charlie, Echo, Foxtrot).</p>
                
                <p>The Local Patrol uses Galactic Republic Clone Z-95s and Y-Wings (BTL-B).</p>

                <h3>The Empire</h3>
                <p>The Empire maintains a local force for dealing with Rebels, pirates, and escorting Imperial shipping. Regular patrols are scouting the area and will respond to cries for help. If you become a big enough threat, the Empire will beef up its patrols and may even form a Pirate Hunter squad. There are also rumors of a secret TIE testing facility nearby. When it comes to pirates, the Empire has a shoot first, ask questions later policy.</p>

                <p>On the mission forces tables, Imperial Squadrons tend to use Greek letters for squadron names (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, Sigma).</p>

                <h3>Merchants, Smugglers, and Civilians</h3>
                <p>Freighters are pirates primary prey. The goal is to swoop in and quickly disable them so we can take enough cargo to be profitable but not ruin their business. Many freighter captains run armed and some have even hired escorts as a result of the losses from piracy. Fortunately for you, they can rarely get top of the line fighters and must use whatever is available.</p>

                <p>On the mission forces tables, Civilian craft tend to use simple name and number designators for squadron names (Freighter 1, Escort 1, Smuggler 1, etc)</p>

                <h3>Mining Guild</h3>
                <p>The asteroid belt you call home contains an active Mining Guild asteroid mining operation. Your base is actually one of their old mining operation stations in a mined out section of the belt. The Guild's pilots are at home among the asteroids and the Guild itself has enough financial backing to be dangerous. They are a legitimate operation and can call on Local System and Imperial patrols for aid, though they will be slower to respond as they have to navigate the asteroid field to arrive. This is why the operation maintains its own security force.</p>

                <h3>Hutt Cartel</h3>
                <p>You aren't the only ones who decided this area was a good one for piracy. Guula the Hutt has set up an operation somewhere in the system and does not want to share territory. The fact you were here first does not matter to them.</p>

                <h3>Rebels</h3>
                <p>The Rebels are a blessing and a curse. Their presence keeps the Empire busy, but also draws in more Imperial forces. Sometimes they are your direct competition as they also prey on the Empire's shipping for supplies and money.</p>
                
                <p>On the mission forces tables, Rebels tend to use colors as squadron names (Red, Blue, Green, Gold, Gray, Black)</p>

            <h2>Flee Thresholds</h2>
            <p>Each faction has its own risk tolerance for how much damage it will take before attempting to flee. Local Patrol are trying to keep the peace, not fight to the death. While Imperial fighter pilots are fanatically brave, their leaders in the larger ships show more discretion. And elite pilots have survived long enough to get experience by having at least some sense of self preservation.</p>
            
            <p>Below is the general rule for the amount of hull remaining that will cause a ship in each of the factions to swap to Flee AI:</p>

            <h2>Threat Level and Determining Enemy Forces</h2>
            <p>As you become more skilled and more successful as pirates, your reputation will proceed you and cause the factions in the area to increase their forces in response. This value will determine the upgrades and abilities of the enemy ships on each mission.</p>
            
            <p>Threat level is a combination of the threat level of the ships you are flying (including upgrades) plus the threat level of the pilot skills you have.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Calculate Your Threat Level</h3>
            <p>To get the Threat Level of an individual Pilot add these things together:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>XP Cost of all your Pilot Upgrades</li>
                <li>Initiative of pilot x 2</li>
                <li>Base Threat Level of your Ship (See Ship Dealer tables below)</li>
                <li>Cost of all Upgrades equipped to your ship</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Average the Threat Levels of the pilots your are bringing on the mission and divide by the number 25, rounding up. This is your Threat level for the mission.</p>
            
            <h3>Enemy Threat Level Upgrades and Abilities</h3>
            <p>Local Patrol Z-95s and Imperial TIE Fighters will always be Threat level 1 unless they are Elites.</p>
