                    <p>Guula the Hutt's forces have been encroaching more and more into our hunting grounds in spite of our repeated warnings. Bait in a squad of their low rank pilots with our Patrol Boat as they pass through our space then destroy them to show we mean business.</p>

Alternatively destroy all of the Hutt forces. If at any point there are no more enemy ships on the board, the Territory becomes Friendly and the mission ends. Keep the Patrol Boat alive. The Patrol Boat may flee the board any turn after at least 1 pirate pilot has deployed.</p>

                        <h4>Pirate Base</h4>
                        <p>The Pirate Base has 2 remaining Turbolaser emplacements which start facing Zone A. They will fire at player ships until Round 9 as the Cartel flees the station OR until the player has landed the Patrol Boat on the station. Once the Patrol Boat has landed, the Turbolaser emplacements are under player control. Cartel ships will shoot at the Turbolaser emplacements once they are under player control if they have no other targets.</p>
                        <p>Once the Patrol Boat has landed and you have reached the end of turn 12, the mission is considered over. You can either choose to end it immediately or have all remaining enemy ships change to Flee AI and play it out.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Freighters</h4>
                        <p>The Freighters are fully loaded and as a result have a maximum speed of 3, cannot boost, and their Agility is reduced by 1 (they still receive range bonus). For this mission, each Freighter has a number of shields equal to the number of player ships. All Freighters with turrets start with the turret arc facing forward.</p>
                        <p>Once a Freighter is reduced to 1-3 Hull, it is considered disabled. Disabled Freighters are considered "Enemy" ships to all other ships for the purposes of bumping (do not roll for damage, may take stress and focus). They will continue drifting at speed 1 straight until they have left the play area or the mission is over. Once they are disabled they do not take actions, perform attacks or take damage from asteroids.</p>

                        <p>The player Patrol Boat arrives on Round 6. To complete the mission the Patrol Boat needs to land in either Docking Bay 1 or 2. If the Patrol Boat is destroyed, the mission is considered a failure. The Patrol Boat may not redeploy once it has landed.</p>
                        <p>Landing the Patrol Boat in a Docking Bay does not prevent Freighters from deploying from that Docking Bay. Players may perform Protect actions on the Patrol Boat.</p>

Only Large Base ships, Medium Base ships, the Quadjumper and the HWK-290 may take the Acquire Cargo action. Quadjumpers and HWK-290s may only acquire 1 cargo each.

                        <h4>Assaulting the Station</h4>
                        <p>Players ships may perform the Protect action on the Patrol Boat. To Unload the Boarding Team, the Patrol Boat must land in one of the station's Docking Bays after the Shield Generators have been destroyed. Place a Tracking Token on the Docking Bay tile to represent the Boarding Team.</p>
                        <p>The Patrol Boat may deploy from the Docking Bay that it landed in on any of the following rounds.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Advancing the Boarding Team</h4>
                        <p>At the end of each turn, roll 3 attack dice. If the number of hits rolled is equal to or greater than the number of emplacements on that station tile, players may move the commandos to an adjacent station tile. Otherwise, they may destroy one emplacement on that tile or simply wait until the next round. Players may choose if Fuel Tanks destroyed this way explode.</p>
                        <p>The Boarding Teams attack dice can be modified depending on the upgrades purchased for the Patrol Boat.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Capturing the Station</h4>
                        <p>The Boarding Team must reach the large central station module with the Command Center. Then they must succeed in their advancement roll to enter the Command Center and capture the station. Any remaining Turbolaser emplacements are now under Pirate control. Players may choose their facing and attack targets for the rest of the mission. If the command center is destroyed Credit rewards are reduced by half.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Freighter Escape AI</h4>
                        <p>The Freighter that launches from Bay 1 will attempt to escape through Vector 6. The Freighter that launches from Bay 2 will attempt to escape through Vector 1.</p>
