                    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                    <p>Rebel activity has caused a great loss to Imperial fighter squadrons in this area. As such their convoys are running with a light escort and many of their pilots are inexperienced. Lure away the escort fighters from one of the convoys while our Patrol Boat impersonates a Local Patrol to hijack some cargo off the freighters. The longer you can keep them occupied, the more loot we can get. But be careful, the longer you wait the more likely a passing patrol will come by to reinforce them. Hopefully we can earn enough to get you out of those flying deathtraps.</p>
