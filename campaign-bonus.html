                    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                    <p>These TYE-Wings aren't going to cut it. We need something with more survivability and firepower. Our Slicer has discovered an impound lot used by Imperial and Local Patrols that has a few ships being held there. We have acquired some Patrol uniforms and false IDs to get into the facility.</p>
                    <p>We will need to fly out through a canyon to hide from sensors and make good our escape. Be sure to sabotage any alarm systems so local patrols are not alerted to our presence.</p>

                <div class="mission-section">
                    <h3>Setup</h3>
                    <p>Up to 3 player pilots deploy from the Impound Center [C] 1 at a time on turn 1, then up to 3 more deploy on turn 2.</p>

                        <h4>Ship Selection</h4>
                        <p>Players are stealing ships in this mission and do not choose their ship ahead of time. To determine what ships they find in the impound lot, have each player roll 1 attack die. Consult the following table for the result. Any Gambler pilot may roll 2 die and pick the one they want.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Blank:</strong> Stock Z-95 with no Upgrades</li>
                            <li><strong>Eye:</strong> Stock Y-Wing with no Upgrades</li>
                            <li><strong>Hit:</strong> Z-95 with Concussion Missiles or M3-A with Ion Cannon</li>
                            <li><strong>Crit:</strong> Choice of Quadjumper or HWK-290 either with $20k credits in a smuggler compartment</li>

                    <h3>Special Rules</h3>
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Territory: Extremely Hostile</strong> - Even if the pilot would survive the ejection role, there is no chance of rescue. Any pilot who is shot down or disabled is considered finished and a replacement pilot will need to be created / hired.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Canyon</h4>
                        <p>The Canyon Walls [B] block line of sight. This means the Turbolaser Turrets [T] and enemy fighters may not shoot at or lock onto player ships that are obstructed by it and vice versa. Enemy fighters that are on top of Canyon Walls may still shoot and lock as if shooting through an obstruction (+1 defense die for the defender). The Sensor Array [A] gives 1 Calculate token to one of the Turbolaser Turrets each turn.</p>
                        <p>The first time a player ship moves through or overlaps Canyon Walls or a board edge (other than zone A), it executes an incomplete maneuver and acts as though it had overlapped an asteroid. Sigma squadron is alerted and will arrive the following turn.</p>
                        <p>Patrol A is armed with Ion Missiles and Patrol B is armed with Ion Cannon Turrets.</p>

                        <p>Maybe they weren't the hot shot pilots they thought they were. Guess we will need to find ourselves some more recruits.</p>
                        <p><strong>Result:</strong> None of the pilots made it out. Restart the campaign.</p>

                        <p>We swiped those ships right out from under their noses. Good flying boys. It will be much easier to raid shipping now that we aren't stuck in those flying deathtraps.</p>
                        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Add Mission Card for Acts of Piracy Mission 1 to the Mission Card deck.</p>
