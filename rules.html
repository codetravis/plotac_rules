            <ol class="pirates-code">
                <li>Every crew member shall have a vote when a Company decision needs to be made.</li>
                <li>An equal share of all treasure to each combatant of a raid with an additional share being set aside for the Company.</li>
                <li>One half of the Company's share will be allotted for supplies, base maintenance, ground crew.</li>
                <li>The other half of the Company's share will be used for maintaining a transport and boarding vessel along with a boarding party. If the share is not split evenly the larger half shall be allotted to base maintenance.</li>
                <li>No gambling or illicit substances while on duty. (Off duty is your business)</li>
                <li>Vacuum suits and weapons are to be maintained and serviceable at all times.</li>
                <li>Desertion of your comrades during a raid while still in an undamaged ship shall be punishable by fine or demotion at the vote of fellow raiders.</li>
                <li>No retirement or disbanding until the Company has shared out a minimum amount of credits. (amount to be determined by a vote of the crew)</li>
                <li>No fighting during raids or on base. Personal disputes are to be settled by a duel at an agreed upon time at a neutral location.</li>

            <h2>Custom Rules</h2>
            
            <h3>Ion Weapons and Ionization</h3>
            <p>Ion weapons are a pirate's best friend. There is a lot more money to be made in capturing ships and seizing their cargo than blowing them up. Also the more destructive you are, the more likely opponents will fight to the death.</p>
            
            <h4>Disabling Ships with Ion Cannons</h4>
            <p>In PLotAC, ships can be permanently disabled with Ion weapons if the final point of damage is done with an Ion weapon OR if the ship is Ionized and has MORE Ion tokens than it has remaining Hull points.</p>
            
            <p>For example a Large base ship with 1 Hull and 2 Ion Tokens is not permanently disabled as it needs 3 Ion Tokens to be ionized. A small base ship with 1 Hull and 1 Ion token is not permanently disabled as 1 Ion token is not MORE than 1 Hull.</p>
            
            <p>Ion weapons only start applying Ion Tokens when all shields are down on the target. As long as the target has shields, for each ion token they would receive, remove one shield instead.</p>
            
            <p>This can be read as: If a ship receives Ion tokens from an attack or device explosion, for each ion token, if there is an active shield, the ship must lose 1 shield to remove the ion token. When there are no shields, ion tokens are applied as normal.</p>
            
            <p>A ship can become Ionized with shields up from other effects, such as Ion Clouds or Feedback Array. If a ship becomes Ionized (1 Ion Token for small base, 2 for medium, 3 for large), it loses all remaining shields at the start of the next turn.</p>
            
            <p>Ion disabled ships can be captured and added to your hangar if you completed the mission successfully under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Mission is in Friendly territory</li>
                <li>The Mission is in Neutral territory, there are no enemy ships remaining on the board, and you have completed the primary objective</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You cannot capture ships in hostile territory. The territory of the mission may change depending on the objectives. The territory check happens after the mission is over.</p>
            
            <p>If a player ship is permanently ionized, it can be recovered intact under the same conditions as capturing an enemy ship.</p>
            
            <p>Ion tokens work as normal otherwise. For example, a small ship with 2 or more hull and an Ion token must still make an Ion maneuver and can only take the focus action, then clears the Ion token.</p>
            
            <h4>Ionization and Emplacements</h4>
            <p>Under normal HotAC rules, emplacements cannot receive Ion Tokens. However in PLotAC there are custom rules regarding emplacements and ionization.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An emplacement requires 2 Ion Tokens to be ionized.</li>
                <li>Emplacements clear all Ion Tokens at the beginning of the turn.</li>
                <li>Turrets that are Ionized may not attack or rotate.</li>
                <li>Shield Generators that are Ionized do not provide their defense die bonus.</li>
                <li>Command Center, Wing Command, Jamming Array, Sensor Array emplacements do not provide any bonuses or perform any actions when ionized.</li>
                <li>Fuel Tanks are volatile and for each Ion Token they receive roll an attack die. On a crit, the Fuel in the Fuel Tank combusts from the Ionization and the Fuel Tank is destroyed. Follow normal Fuel Tank destruction rules.</li>
                <li>Cargo Containers take damage from Ion weapons as normal and do not receive Ion Tokens</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Ship Limitations</h4>
            <p>The pirates may only bring 1 Large base ship on each mission. This is in addition to the Patrol Boat on missions where it accompanies you. There are no restrictions on small and medium base ships.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to the ships that they are flying, the player pilots may have 1 ship per pilot stored in the base hangar. If you are to exceed that number in some way, either through purchase or capturing a prize, you must choose to sell some number of ships so that you don't exceed 1 extra per pilot.</p>
            
            <h4>Upgrades</h4>
            <p>Generic crew members may be hired with credits like any other upgrade and stay as a permanent upgrade until the ship is shot down. Crew may be transferred between ships at no cost.</p>
            
            <p>Scum Crew may be hired for a single mission with credits by any pilot. After the mission is over, you lose that upgrade but it can be repurchased. If a Scum Crew is equipped and your ship is disabled in hostile territory or destroyed in any territory, that Crew is lost and is removed from the upgrade table. The same is true for Named Astromech upgrades.</p>
            
            <p>The Organizer and Cyborg careers may also hire Scum Crew upgrades permanently using XP. Cyborg is limited to Droid Scum Crew (see upgrade cost chart for reference). The same rules apply for removing them from the upgrade table no matter how they are hired.</p>
            
            <p>All ship upgrades are paid for with Credits. You cannot spend XP to pay for ship upgrades. Charts listing their cost in thousands of credits can be found in the appropriate section of the document.</p>
            
            <p>If you wish to move upgrades other than Crew or Astromech from one ship to another, you must pay half of the upgrade cost rounded up (for example a 3 cost upgrade would cost 2 to move to another ship).</p>
